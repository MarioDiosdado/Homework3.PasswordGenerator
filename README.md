# PasswordGenerator

This project generates a random password with the user requirements.

The following options are available:

1. __Lowercase__

The user needs to click on Generate Password, after that a series of questions will follow asking the user to specify the lenght and what options does he want.

The password must be between 8 and 128 characters.
